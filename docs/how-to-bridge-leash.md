# üåâ **How to Bridge LEASH to Solana**

> **üö® CRITICAL UPDATE**: The LEASH contract on Ethereum still has an active rebase function that can change supply, despite claims of being "renounced" and "immutable". Bridge to Solana for true supply stability!

---

## üö® **Why Bridge LEASH to Solana?**

### **The Ethereum LEASH Problem**
According to the [official Shiba Inu investigation](https://blog.shib.io/leash-investigation-how-supply-changed-despite-renounced-claims/):

- **On August 11, 2025**, LEASH total supply increased **~10%** (‚âà10,765 tokens)
- **Despite years of messaging** that supply was fixed and rebasing was disabled
- **Hidden rebase pathways** survived ownership renouncement and continue to function
- **The system appears decentralized** but maintains functional control over supply adjustments

### **What This Means for You**
- Your **percentage ownership** stays the same, but **absolute token counts change**
- **Market cap and price math** becomes confusing and unreliable
- **Trust in "fixed supply"** is no longer credible under the current v1 contract
- **Future rebases can happen again** through the same hidden pathways

### **The Solana Solution**
- **True immutable supply** - no rebase functions, no hidden pathways
- **Transparent governance** through Doggy DAO
- **Audited smart contracts** with clear, minimal roles
- **Community-driven development** with no backdoors
