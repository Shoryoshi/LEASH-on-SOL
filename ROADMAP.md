# 🚀 LEASH V2 Development Roadmap

> **From Scaffold to Production: A Complete Journey to Solana Mainnet with SHI Algorithmic Stablecoin**

## 🎯 **Current Status: Vision Ready**

We've built a **professional-grade scaffold** that demonstrates our technical vision and architecture. This is designed to:
- **Show the community** our complete roadmap
- **Attract developers** and contributors
- **Build partnerships** with other protocols
- **Demonstrate competence** to investors and stakeholders

**Introducing SHI**: The algorithmic stablecoin that Ryoshi originally envisioned, now realized on Solana. SHI will serve as the foundation for expanded liquidity pools and enhanced fee generation, creating a sustainable economic engine for the entire ecosystem.

- [ ] **Bridge security** (leverages wormhole infrastrucuture)

#### 🎯 **Revenue Optimization**
- [ ] **Partner integrations** (DeFi protocols, NFT marketplaces)
- [ ] **Fee optimization** (dynamic fee structures based on usage)
- [ ] **Yield farming** (treasury funds deployed for additional yield)
- [ ] **SHI ecosystem fees** (enhanced revenue from stablecoin operations)

---

### **Phase 6: Ecosystem Expansion**
**Status: 🟢 Planned**

#### 🎟️ **Gatekeeper & Allowlists**
- [ ] **LEASH-gated mints** (NFTs, tokens, exclusive access)
- [ ] **veLEASH allowlists** (priority access to partner launches)
- [ ] **xLEASH benefits** (staking rewards, partner perks)
- [ ] **Tiered access system** (based on token holdings and lock duration)
- [ ] **SHI-gated features** (stablecoin holders get additional benefits)

#### 📱 **User Experience**

- [ ] **Governance interface** (proposal creation, voting, execution)
- [ ] **SHI stability dashboard** (price tracking, rebase history, LP status)
- [ ] **Mobile applications** (iOS/Android staking and governance)
- [ ] **Analytics dashboard** (protocol metrics, user statistics)

#### 🌐 **Cross-Chain DeFi**
- [ ] **Multi-chain staking** (stake on Solana, earn on Ethereum)
- [ ] **Cross-chain governance** (vote on proposals across networks)
- [ ] **Unified rewards** (earn rewards regardless of which chain you use)
